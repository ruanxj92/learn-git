Time machine
============
check the status of repository with `git status`:  
    
    $ git status
    
see the difference of a file e.g.:  
    
    $ git diff README.md
    
check the modification history with `git log`:  

    $ git log

or a simpler display:  
 
    $ git log --pretty=oneline
    
return to last version:  

    $ git reset --hard HEAD^
    
or return to otehr version:

    $ git rest --hard 3628164
    
`3628164` could be other commit id 
Version returing is veryu fast, because only the pointer is changed.  

Git provids `git reflog` to track all the history commands:  

    $ git reflog

Working directory and stage
---------------------------
Working directory is the directory initiated with `git init`, like '/learngit'.  
There is a hiden directory `.git` in working directory. It is not a working directory but storing a lot, including `stage` and branches.   
`stage` is the temporary directory storing files added by `git add`. `git commit` added the files from `stage` to corelated branch.

manage modification
-------------------
Each modification of files must be `git add filename` into `stage` before added into a branch with `git commit ...`.  
So, `git add ...` adds modification of a file from working directory to `stage`. `git commit ...` adds all the modifacation from `stage` to a branch.  

discard modification
--------------------
use `git checkout -- <file>` to discard changes in working directory before `git add <file>`

	$ git checkout -- <file>

`--` is important, without which `git checkout <branchname>` means change to other branch.

use `git reset HEAD <file>` to diacard changes before `git add <file>`

	$ git reset HEAD <file>

delete files
------------
Normly delete a file on linux:  

	$ rm <file>

Delete a file from a git repository:  

	$ git rm <file>

If you regret, and want to recover the file from repository:  
	
	$ git checkout -- <file>
