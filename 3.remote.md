Remote repository
=================
GitHub.com is a website keeping git repositories. It could be used to keep public repositories remotely.
Before really starting using github, SSH key is required. SSH key is generated:  

	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "<emailaddress>"

Input all the required information if necessary, otherwise, let them be default or empty.
Find SSH key pair in 

	$ cd ~/.ssh

copy the content in `id_rsa.pub`. paste them in   
github.com ==> personal settings ==> SSH & GPG Keys ==> New SSH Key  
input tile and paste public key in `key`, click `Add SSH key`  

Adding remote repository
------------------------
Since having a local git repository and remote git repository, here is how them work together.
first create a remote repository:  

github.com ==> New repository ==> input the name as remoteRepositoryname and description ==> Create repository  

connect local repository with remote repository:  

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<yourGitHubName>/<remoteRepositoryname>.git
 
`origin` is the default name of git. 
push the content of local repository to remote:

	git push -u origin master

after pushing, the repository can be seen on github.com
Now, any changed in local git repository can be pushed to remote repository:  

	git push origin master

SSH warning
-----------
The fisrt `clone` or `push` to github may receive a massage from github like:  

	The authenticity of host 'github.com (xx.xx.xx.xx)' can't be established.
	RSA key fingerprint is xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

clone from remote repository:  

	git clone <remoteRepository>

e.g. `git clone git@github.com:michaelliao/gitskills.git` 
<remoteRepository> supports https and ssh supported origin git:// address.
