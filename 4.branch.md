branch management
=================
create a new branch `dev`

	$ git checkout -b dev
	
`git check -b` means create a new branch and switch to it, equals to:  

	$ git branch dev
	$ git checkout dev

see current branch:  

	$ git branch

switch to another branch:  

	$ git check master

merge work result from another branch `dev` to current branch `master`:  

	$ git check master
	$ git merge dev 

delete a branch e.g. delete `dev`:  

	$ git branch -d dev

conflict in branches
-------------------
when mergeing two branches with conflicts, you may see something like:  
	$ git merge dev
	Auto-merging README.md
	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

see the content in README.md, you may see something like:  
    
    Git tracks changes of files.
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Creating a new branch is quick & simple.
    =======
    Creating a new branch is quick AND simple.
    >>>>>>> feature1

git uses `<<<<<<<`,`=======`,`>>>>>>>` to mark the difference.
Edit the file `README.md` to fix the conflic. And submit again.
Conflic solved.

    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit -m "conflict fixed"

Branches managing strategy
--------------------------
If possible, git tends to merge in fast forward mode. However,in fast forward mode, branch information will be lost when deleting a branch. When fast forward mode is diabled, branch information is remained.  
Merge a branch off-fast-forward with commit:  
    
    $ git merge --no-ff -m "merge with no-ff" dev

Deal with bug branch
--------------------
When you want to record current working directory and do some bug-fixing in another branch, `git stash` would help.

    $ git stash

The working directory has recorded, `git stash list` shows the recorded working directory.

    $ git stash list

When bug-fixing was done, the recorded working directory is restored with `git stash apply` and discard it in stash list with `git stash drop`or `git stash pop` to do both.

    $ git stash apply
    $ git stash drop

or

    $ git stash pop
