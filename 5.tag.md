Tag management
==============
Tag is a user friendly name for a version, conbined with a commit.  
Usually tag is added on the latest commit:  

	$ git tag <tagname>

If you want to add tag on an older version: 
first use `git log` to find the `commit id` of the target version:  

	$ git log

then add tag to the target version with commit id(normally commit id is a serials of digit and letters):  

	$ git tag <tagname> <commit_id>

delete a tag(e.g. delete v0.1):  
	
	$ git tag -d v0.1

push a tag to remote:  

	$ git push origin v1.0

push all tags to remote:  

	$ git push origin --tags

delete a remote tag(e.g. delete a remote tag v0.9):  
first delete the local tag:  

	$ git tag -d v0.9

then delete the remote tag:  

	$ git push origin : ref/tags/v0.9
